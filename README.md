# Dear Moon

This is my first react web page. I want it to be a space that I talk about things that are close to my hurt. I also want it to be a place of beauty. I guess this will be a DBT blog LOL. Where I admire the beauty of nature and life and also speak about the difficulties of life. I guess this will be a space to hold both.
