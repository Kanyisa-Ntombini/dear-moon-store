          There are so many stereotypes around disabled people. As a disabled
          person, I also carry some prejudices against other disabled people.
          Sia released a movie, Music, that is filled with stereotypes about
          autistic people. Many people in the disability community, especially
          the autism community, have been criticising the movie because they
          portrayed the disabled character in such a terrible way. Please check
          out #ActuallyAutistic for the responses of the autism community of the
          movie.

          <br /><br />

          My boyfriend's eight-year-old cousin became friends with a non-verbal
          boy around his age. I think he is on the Autism spectrum. I was
          shocked they were friends. I had an incorrect idea that non-verbal
          people on the Autism spectrum are not sociable. This little boy loves
          playing with other kids his age so much. While my boyfriend's cousin
          was around he would come over every day to fetch him so they can play
          soccer. He still occasionally comes over to check if he is around. I
          always find him riding his bike with other children his age. I always
          see him in a group of other children. I am very ashamed that I have
          been shocked by the fact that he has a lot of friends like other abled
          children. I am working towards actively challenging that prejudice but
          it will be difficult because this is a narrative I have been fed from
          a young age.

          <br /><br />
          I think these prejudices are so dangerous when we think about
          protecting the rights of disabled children. My friend Ntsiki was
          attacked by people on Twitter because she posted an article that said
          it is problematic for parents to wish for "healthy" children when they
          are pregnant. I just want to state I do not have children. I just
          speak from my experience as someone who was a disabled child. Ntsiki
          is a single black mother of two. I think most people think it is
          harmless to want a healthy child. Surely there is nothing wrong with
          wanting a child who will not “suffer”?
          <br /><br />
          So here are my problems with this statement. Firstly, I will have to
          explain the definition of disability. The medical community uses the
          medical model of disability. This medical model in its simplest form
          says disability is a result of a part of your body being sick or
          broken. As a result, it needs to be fixed. As disabled activists, we
          reject this model because it frames disabled people as broken. We
          follow the social model. This model says our society actively
          discriminates against us. As a result, this discrimination affects our
          ability to get health care, education, work opportunities, etc. This
          leads us to live undignified lives. So I will make this example. There
          is nothing wrong with being black. Wishing you don't have a black
          child because you don't want them to face racism does not make sense.
          What you should want as a potential parent is a world where the is no
          racism and your child can live a free and dignified life. This is the
          same principle with disabled children. Having a disabled child is
          expensive because the government only provides services for abled
          bodied children. This is blatant discrimination. Public health care,
          schooling, work opportunities, transport, public amenities are not
          made to be used by disabled people. It is shocking that 27 years after
          democracy we are all okay with this. So because all of these
          opportunities are not available to disabled people, people interpret
          it as the fact that disabled people do not belong in society.
          <br /><br />
          One of the problems with parents wanting a non-disabled child is
          because it is just not a practical wish. Disability can happen at any
          point in your lifetime. I became disabled at 11. Most children become
          diagnosed with autism at around 2. I remember watching a video made by
          a disabled doctor. While he was in medical school he was in a car
          accident and had a spinal injury. As a result, he became disabled. His
          mother did not care that he was disabled. She moved in with him and
          became his caregiver. As a result, he was able to finish medical
          school and become a doctor. On the other hand, his father completely
          rejected him. On top of this, he decided to leave his wife. Imagine
          throwing away a marriage of over two decades because of your prejudice
          against disabled people! This is why it is so important that current
          and potential parents educate themselves about disability. You don't
          want to be the person who breaks your child spirit because of your own
          bigotry. In other more extreme cases, parents and care-givers have
          killed their disabled children. Some believe they are doing their
          children a “favour” because they are no longer “suffering” from
          disability. They do not understand that suffering is caused by
          discrimination from society. An even more disturbing trend is that
          often people feel sorry for these caregivers when they have killed
          their disabled children. They see it as the worst thing to be a parent
          or caregiver of a disabled person.
          <br /><br />
          This is why I challenge all of you to interrogate any prejudices you
          have against disabled people. Educate yourselves! Ableism, like other
          forms of bigotry, is dangerous and we as a society need to end it.
