        <p>
          I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. My interests are in
          Javascript and Python. I am currently learning Front End development
          using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am also interested in building
          chatbots and Machine Learning. You can find more information about me
          in my resume. 
          <br><br>
          I am partially sighted due to a condition called
          Keratoconus. As a result, I am a disability activist. I want to build
          accessible websites so everyone can use them despite their physical or
          mental condition. 
          <br><br>
          When not coding, I like taking nature walks, looking
          for the cosiest coffee shops in town or spending time with my friends
          and family. I am also an avid knitter!
